In order to build a model that can take 'random' text as input and 
output structured data in the format seen in Australian Vehicle Prices.csv,
I need to generate thousands of examples where the structured data gets transformed 
into descriptions. With this data, I can train a multi-layer perceptron to transform 
a tokenized sentence into a vector of fixed size. 

Therefore, I used ChatGPT to generate descriptions car details (details_to_descriptions.csv),
then, on this limited data, trained a T5 Speech model to take in these car details and generate 
the descriptions for me (details_to_descriptions.py). I ran this T5 model on my entire dataset (descriptions_to_details.py)
and generated descriptions for my entire dataset (generated_descriptions.csv). Now, I will use this to 
train a model to take in these descriptions and produce structured data (i.e Brand, Year, Model, etc). 

I copied the csv file into my main folder, and renamed it structured_data_descriptions.csv.
